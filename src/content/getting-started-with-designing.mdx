          Design systems have become an essential tool for teams building digital products. They provide a 
          single source of truth for design elements, patterns, and guidelines, ensuring consistency across 
          products and streamlining the workflow between designers and developers.

        <h2>What is a Design System?</h2>
        <p>
          A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be 
          assembled to build any number of applications. It's more than just a UI kit or pattern library—it's 
          a complete set of standards, documentation, and principles along with the toolkit to achieve those standards.

        <h3>1. Design Tokens</h3>
        <p>
          Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system—specifically, they are named entities that 
          store visual design attributes. They are used in place of hard-coded values in order to maintain a 
          scalable and consistent visual system.
